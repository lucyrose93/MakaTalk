## MakaTalk

In collaboration with Brent Child and Family Clinic, and the Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families.

MakaTalk is an iPad app that uses Makaton sign language in order to assess the mental health status of young people with learning difficulties. Clinicians currently conduct pre and post session questionnaires using pen and paper, which rely on patients' ability to associate faces with emotions. This is not the best communication medium for all of the patients.


## Why?
Currently the forms tend to be filled out by the patient's parents and thus don't accurately represent the views of the young person. Using the app allows the clinician to get instant feedback about the mental health status of the patient, so that the therapy session is more tailored to their needs.

## How?
An app that collects patient feedback on their week and their therapy session, which utilises a more familiat questioning format, i.e. makaton videos, and more accesible representations of patient's emotional status 


## User Journey

As a clinician I want to better understand the experiences of my service users and the feedback from our sessions so that I can get a better understanding of their needs and use that to inform our sessions and their treatment.

As a patient, I want to be able to express what is troubling me so that I can get help.

## Stretch goals

* As a clinician I want to be able to present a modified version of the questionnaire based on the severity of the patient's learning difficulties, so that the app is effective for people with mild, moderate and severe difficulties

* As a clinician I would like to incorporate traffic light style colour representations into my questionnaire, so that young people with moderate-severe learning difficulties can engage with the questions

* As a clinician I would like to be able to have a unique code for each patient so I don't have not use their name, so that I can abide by regulation around patient data protection

* Get the parents' and teachers' feedback on the content of the form for the patient too

* Implement rewards for patients who regularly fill out the forms

* Multiple language support: eg. Portuguese, Somali, Tamil

* Ability for clinician to input their own questions

## Prototype Feedback


|  Strength | Notes  |   
|---|---|
| Instant Feedback | Being able to use the results straight away in sessions helps build a rapport with young people straight away and will help guide the session they are about to have |
| Accesible Results | Results page was especially useful as we never have results of the questionnaire straight away until the next session (which is currently unhelpful) |
| User-friendly Design | They loved the user-friendly design and its simplicity |
| Login Page |  Clinicians like having their own private account to manage all their patients |
| User Engagement | Clinicians are excited to engage young people using modern technology instead of paper and pen |

|  Improvement | Notes  |   
|---|---|
| Survey Options | Users would like each question with the Makaton video to still be available next to the options (so the question Makaton video + the options Makaton video to be on the same screen if possible) |
| Survey Guidance | After each question, the person doing the makaton to say, “you choose” |
| Auto Replay | When the young person touches their response, the video for that response to be played again |
